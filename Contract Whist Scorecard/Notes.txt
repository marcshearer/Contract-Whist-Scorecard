Bugs fix now
------------

Short-term
----------
Add tests for temporary settings
Add tests for history / location to check they're not saved if play a game
Auto-sync when download players in Get Started?

TODO
----
Get rid of warnings in console
Jumps to scorepad coming from hand for the second time. Probably due to the resizing problem (where we now do nothing till width is right in viewDidLayoutSubviews) - Made this not reuse scorepad to solve
    but could cause memory problems
Avoid repeated failure in recovery - save counter and after 3 failed recoveries give override
