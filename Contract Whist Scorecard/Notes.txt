Swift Gotchas / hints
---------------------
For good resizing on rotation call view.setNeedsLayout() from viewWillTransition and then override viewDidLayoutSubviews (see HandViewController) - NOTE - NOT viewWillLayoutSubviews - Also look at the animateAlongside approach in ScorepadViewController
Uncaught exception crashes are normally caused by
    Invalid reuse identifiers on list views / collection views
    Invalid names on segues
    Outlets not being set up correctly
To avoid flashing animations need to put the things that you want to animate inside another view
To animate (esp with constraints) need to call layoutIfNeeded immediately before and during animation - see Utility.animate()
When collection has spaces in it re-set the inter-item space and set scroll to horizontal
When button bar (or navigation bar) doesn't appear set the title in the parent view
If you get a duplicate navigation bar you can hide the default one with self.showNavigationBar()
Popovers on iPhone - need to set up the view to have a size of freedom and a status bar of none plus the stuff in prepare for segue
You can force a label to resize to fill its space by setting a height constraint and then setting this progammatically to a very large number
Get a crash with NS Fetch Controller if don't get rid of any pointers to cells before try to remove from collection view. Also it calls numberOfItemsIn Section internally and if you are adding or deleting cells you need to return +/- 1 or see the change below about deletePlayer()
Need to login to iCloud on each simulator
Default UserDefault settings are in AppDelegate
You can make a controller a delegate for a child view and hence receive information on things changing back in the parent
The parent or the child view can detect popover closure by adopting UIPopoverPresentationControllerDelegate and declaring popoverPresentationControllerShouldDismissPopover etc
Swipes are associated with a specific control - look at the swipes right click - gesture recognizer in referencing outlet connections
There is a problem in collection views when you delete or insert items. You have to do this in a batch update with the change to the counter - see deletePlayer() in StatsViewController
Note that frame sizes are not correct yet until you get to viewDidAppear - you might have to avoid returning non-zero table view row count until you get to this point - see HandViewController
Table views don't always scroll in Swift 4 - set   tableView.delaysContentTouches = TRUE (Best through User-Defined Runtime Attributes in Storyboard editor)
To select a cell at initial display in a table view need to call cell.setSelected and tableView.selectRow from tableView.willDisplay (See SearchViewController)
To make an image transparent background use Preview. Click the toolbox and a toolbar appears. Select the wand. Drag a rectangle anywhere in background. Turns red. Press delete. File/Save.
To remove menus from test scripts
    1,$s/[/][*][@]START_MENU_TOKEN[@][*][/]//g
    1,$s/[/][*].*[@]END_MENU_TOKEN[@][*][/]//g
Error message '/Users/Home/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData' - Go to Product / Clean
When Table View wasn't scrolling it was because "Delay Touch Down" wasn't checked
Bot testing needs to have simulator set up sensibly - go into Xcode Server user to do this
Commands to sort out firewall prompt
    sudo /usr/libexec/ApplicationFirewall/socketfilterfw --setglobalstate off
    /usr/libexec/ApplicationFirewall/socketfilterfw --add /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/MacOS/Xcode
    /usr/libexec/ApplicationFirewall/socketfilterfw --add /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Applications/Simulator.app/Contents/MacOS/Simulator
    sudo /usr/libexec/ApplicationFirewall/socketfilterfw --setglobalstate on
Remapped home and end etc using ~/Library/KeyBindings/DefaultKeyBinding.dict - Did Ctrl-C etc in the keyboard settings app shortcuts but then reversed it
To get rid of insets in a table view need to include willDisplayCell delegate routine and set content to be fixed insets of zero. See ReviewViewController
