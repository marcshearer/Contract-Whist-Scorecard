Changes since last version
--------------------------

Bugs fix now
------------

iPad shows last game rather than current game summary when Viewing scores
Dealer halo not appearing any more
Should reject same player connecting to game twice

Short-term
----------
Add tests for temporary settings
Add tests for history / location to check they're not saved if play a game
Auto-sync when download players in Get Started?

TODO
----
Get rid of warnings in console
Jumps to scorepad coming from hand for the second time. Probably due to the resizing problem (where we now do nothing till width is right in viewDidLayoutSubviews) - Made this not reuse scorepad to solve
    but could cause memory problems
Avoid repeated failure in recovery - save counter and after 3 failed recoveries give override
Avoid HandViewController having cells defined in storyboard for each suit (to avoid unfortunate reuse on phones). Better to make this cell a xib file
